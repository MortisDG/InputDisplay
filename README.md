# InputDisplay
A simple DisplayInput for most USB controllers.

As of right now the Input Display lacks some of it's customization. This will be added in future update.
It's purely made with Electron using HTML, CSS and JS (and some json for storing things). 

Feel free to give feedback and ideas to add!

## Download can be found on the releases!
Make sure to download the InputDisplay.zip and not the Source Code!
